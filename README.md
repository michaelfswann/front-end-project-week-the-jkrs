# PlusMentor Client

School of Code Week 8 group project: PlusMentor.

School of Code Bootcampers are assigned a mentor for the duration of the bootcamp. Mentors are people within the tech industry who offer guidance to bootcampers.

PlusMentor is a tool for generating natural conversation during School of Code mentorship chats.

Users sign up then login to get talking points, a post-it note feature, icebreaking ideas and a tick list of initial topics.

This client runs [here](https://plusmentor.netlify.app/).
